# Contributing to Noblox.js
Like all projects, we have some guidlines for contributing to this project. 
We enjoy having your feedback and code, but sometimes, it's just to much or not enough so here are a couple guide lines for creating issues.
Any ways, thanks for reading this, and please, don't think we don't want you here.
## Creating Issues
- Make your issues relevant. Probablly the most self-explanatory rule but here it is, don't push an issue just to say "My dog died yesterday." I know that news is sad but it doesn't belong in the issues section even though it is an issue with your dog.
Not putting things that don't belong allow us to quickly answer other people issues rather than wasting time closing irrelevant issues.
- Make your issues appropriate. Yes, we know, there is always that ten year old on github and it's frusturating because them being there means you can't swear, but trust me, no one wants you swearing here.
- Make your issues about, well, Noblox stuff. If you know it's an issue with NPM don't come on here and say, "OMG, I've re-installed NPM three times, re-installed windows twice, and tried to re-install Noblox fifty times, and I'm still getting the error that says it couldn't find the repository nopblox."
