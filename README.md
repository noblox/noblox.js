## About

Noblox.js is a node module that was forked from <a href="https://github.com/sentanos/roblox-js">sentanos's roblox-js module</a>. This project was created because the roblox-js repository was no longer maintained by sentanos.

Noblox.js allows you to do things you would normally do on the [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com) website through a Node.js interface. You can use noblox.js along with Roblox's [HttpService feature](http://wiki.roblox.com/index.php?title=API:Class/HttpService) to create scripts that interact with the website. If you're looking for more information on how to create something like this, check out [this](https://github.com/sentanos/roblox-js-server) repository by sentanos. Keep in mind that this does not use the latest version of this module and it is **highly** encouraged that you learn to use the library directly.

## Prerequisites

- [**node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)

## Installation

With node.js installed simply run: 
```bash
# Run this to install noblox.js locally to your repository. 
$ npm install noblox.js --save

# Run this instead to install noblox.js globally so you can use it anywhere.
$ npm install noblox.js -g
```
That's it!

## Documentation

You can find the current noblox.js wiki with all API documentation [here](https://noblox.js.org/). Keep in mind that all methods may not be documented. A majority of the new features that can be found in noblox.js are not in roblox-js. There will be new documentation coming in with v5.0.0. 

## Making use of new login workaround
> Note, as of v4.6.0 The way you login to Noblox has changed significantly.
> The library is no longer responsible for refreshing your cookies
>
> This is because of many reasons including that creating a file caused many security & usability issues and made the library incompatible with some hosts.
### Initial setup
1. Remove any usages of the `login` or `cookieLogin` methods.
2. Run `setCookie` with your cookie. This will store your cookie internally and validate it, but will perform **no** cookie refresh automatically
3. While this works, Roblox `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookies expire after an unknown length of time. For applications which run continuously, **you must** use the function `refreshCookie` to prevent this. This will refresh either the cookie you pass or the internally stored cookie and return the new one.
4. You need to store this new cookie somewhere - whether it be in a database or a JSON file file.

> Note: By default, setCookie will validate the cookie you provide by making a HTTP request.
> To Disable this behaviour, pass `false` as the second parameter (validate)
    
### Getting your cookie (Chrome):
1. Open any Roblox page and login
2. Press `Control + Shift + i` on your keyboard
3. Click `Application`
4. Find `.ROBLOSECURITY`. Copy it's contents, which will start with `_|WARNING:-DO`
5. Put this full token, *including* the warning into cookieLogin: `rbx.setCookie( tokenHere )`
    
### Example
This example makes use of the new async-await syntax.
```js
const rbx = require("noblox.js")
async function startApp () {
    await rbx.setCookie("_|WARNING:-DO-NOT-SHARE-THIS.--Sharing-this-will-allow-someone-to-log-in-as-you-and-to-steal-your-ROBUX-and-items.|_F9F1EA531adk")
    // Do everything else, calling functions and the like.
    let currentUser = await rbx.getCurrentUser()
}
```

## Drawbacks
- You need to set up something to store and refresh cookies yourself 
- If the application is offline for like a week to a month you may need to get the cookie again
- Roblox-js-server is **not** currently compatible. Use [noblox.js-server](https://github.com/Hamzah-z/noblox.js-server) instead.
